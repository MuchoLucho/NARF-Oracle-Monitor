Licencia MIT/GPL

The MIT License is a free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
It is a permissive free software license, meaning that it permits reuse within proprietary software provided 
all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the copyright notice. 
Such proprietary software retains its proprietary nature even though it incorporates software under the MIT 
License. The license is also GPL-compatible, meaning that the GPL permits combination and redistribution with
software that uses the MIT License.

Notable software packages that use one of the versions of the MIT License include Expat, the Mono development 
platform class libraries, Ruby on Rails, Nodejs, Lua (from version 5.0 onwards), Wayland and the X Window 
System, for which the license was written.

The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or GPL) is the most widely used free software 
license, which guarantees end users (individuals, organizations, companies) the 
freedoms to use, study, share (copy), and modify the software. Software that allows 
these rights is called free software and, if the software is copylefted, then it also 
requires that this be retained. The GPL demands both. The license was originally 
written by Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation (FSF) for the GNU project.

In other words, the GPL grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the 
Free Software Definition[6] and uses copyleft to ensure the freedoms are preserved 
whenever the work is distributed, even when the work is changed or added to. The GPL 
is a copyleft license, which means that derived works can only be distributed under 
the same license terms. This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, 
of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are the standard examples. GPL was the 
first copyleft license for general use.
